% This code simulated the energy detection in the cognitive radio when the
% sensing channel is Rayleigh flat-fading channel.

%The assumptions are following: 
% 1) The primary signal is deterministic and binal phase-shift-keying
% (BPSK).
% 2) Noise is real Gaussian with mean 0 and variance 1.

% The probability of detection for Rayleigh channel can be calculated
% by the averaging the probability of detection for AWGN channel, which is
% given by (1) below.
% Pd_theory_awgn = marcumq(sqrt(L*snr),sqrt(thresh),L./2); % --------(1) The probability of detection when the channel is AWGN. 
% The probability of detection for Rayleigh channel is given by (2), at the
% end of the code.

% Please refer the tutorial paper of the energy detection theory titled
% "Unveiling the Hidden Assumptions of Energy Detector Based Spectrum Sensing for
% Cognitive Radios."

% This code is written by Sanket Kalamkar, Indian Institute of Technology
% Kanpur, India.
